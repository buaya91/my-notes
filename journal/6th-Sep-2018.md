How to solve the update PK problem in DDB?

Maybe we should add more context into the datastore

### Update flow

1. Create new record with tag=created for update email X
2. Delete old record
3. Return user, at the same time remove tag created 1

#### Reasoning

Handle partial failure:

if 2! failed, we dont want 1! to work, this can be achieve by checking the tag when login, if tag exists with old email X, check if email X exists, if yes, then this indicate a partial failure on previous email update, thus we should reject the request.

edge case: What happen if emailX was deleted for other reason?

It won't work, because we cannot differentiate the reason of deletion, it can be change email or real deletion
