# Recursive scheme 

It is hard to describe what problem it solves as it is something really general, so I'll start with what is it.

Most functional programming pattern have similar problem in that there are not solving specific problem but a general pattern that when followed gives you a lot of benefit.

It could because having a theoretical foundation.

## What is it ?

It is a programming pattern in functional programming that make use of GADT and Functor (Is Traverse required??).

It describes some specific form of potential recursive computation in a composable way (this means we can describe some basic building block and reuse them here and there)

## Example driven notes ~~~

Brain gives me some example please???
