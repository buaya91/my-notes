## Things to watch out when doing big refactor

1. Have a concrete plan before starting, because refactoring is
different from adding new feature, during refactoring, you might change
a lot of code architecture, and you really dont want to do all of them
in 1 go
2. If possible, split the work into small chunk, even if it means you
rewrite more code, as writing 500 LOC twice is better than 800LOC at once
